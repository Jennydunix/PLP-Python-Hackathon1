# Python Programs

## 1. functions.py - Fibonacci Sequence

This Python program generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified term `n`. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

### Program Requirements:

- Ask the user to input the value of `n`.
- Create a function that takes `n` as a parameter and returns a list containing the first `n` terms of the Fibonacci sequence.
- Print the generated Fibonacci sequence.

## 2. conditions.py - Conditional Statements

This Python program prompts a user to enter their age, then uses a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18. Depending on the result of the condition, it prints either "You are eligible to vote" or "You are not eligible to vote".

### Program Requirements:

- Prompt the user to enter their age.
- Use a conditional statement to check if the age is greater than or equal to 18.
- Print "You are eligible to vote" if the condition is true, otherwise print "You are not eligible to vote".
